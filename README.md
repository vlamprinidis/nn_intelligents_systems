# Projects in Neural Networks and Intelligents Systems
First project: Training and optimization of classifiers (Gaussian Naive Bayes, kNN, MLP) on two datasets using pipelines and gridsearchcv from Scikit-Learn.

Second project: A content-based recommender system (via cosine similarity) and a semantic illustration of a movie collection using Self Organizing Maps (SOMs).

Third project: Derivative-free optimization of functions using genetic algorithms.

Team members: Lamprinidis-Lentel Vlantislav, Marmanis Iason
